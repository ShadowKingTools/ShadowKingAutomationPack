# ShadowKingAutomationPack

User-triggered PowerShell/.bat routines for repeatable Windows gaming + workflow setups.

## What this is
A small toolkit of scripts that runs only when the user launches it (no background service).

## Routines (WIP)
- SessionPrep
- LaunchStack
- PerformanceProfile
- CleanupSession
- RestoreBaseline

## Safety / trust
- Source is public
- Clear diffs between releases
- Each routine includes a short “what this changes” section
- (Planned) -WhatIf / dry-run mode for routines that modify settings
